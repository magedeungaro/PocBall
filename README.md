## [PLAY BOUNCET ON ITCH.IO](https://magedbgt.itch.io/bouncet)

Bouncet is my dream come true. As a gamer myself and a really curious person, I couldn't help but wonder how games were made. And when I became a developer, I just knew I had to do it. Luckily, I'm also married to a developer - and, of course, a gamer - and we united our knowledge and creativity to participate in our first game jam together.
